    "# Robust Error Handling for CSV File Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading and processing CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files in production environments presents numerous challenges that can compromise data integrity and system stability. CSV files, despite their simple format, often arrive from various sources with inconsistent formatting, encoding issues, and data quality problems. Common issues include malformed data, missing columns, incorrect delimiters, mixed data types, and encoding variations. These files may also be corrupted, truncated, or too large for available memory. Additionally, system-level issues such as insufficient permissions, network interruptions during file transfers, or concurrent access attempts can further complicate the reading process. Current CSV reading implementations often handle only basic error cases, leading to unexpected crashes, data corruption, or silent failures that are difficult to diagnose and debug."

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Design and implement a comprehensive error handling system for CSV file processing that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identifies and appropriately responds to all potential failure points in the CSV reading pipeline\n",
    "2. Provides detailed, actionable error messages that facilitate quick problem resolution\n",
    "3. Implements robust logging mechanisms for error tracking and system monitoring\n",
    "4. Manages system resources effectively, particularly when dealing with large files\n",
    "5. Preserves data integrity through proper validation and sanitization\n",
    "6. Enables graceful degradation and recovery options where possible\n",
    "7. Maintains processing efficiency while incorporating these safety mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution must handle both technical errors (file system issues, memory constraints) and data-related errors (format problems, validation failures) while remaining maintainable and adaptable to different business requirements. It should strike a balance between being thorough enough to catch all critical issues and efficient enough to not significantly impact performance during normal operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Success Criteria\n",
    "The implementation will be considered successful if it:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prevents all unhandled exceptions from reaching the end user\n",
    "* Reduces system crashes due to CSV processing by 99%\n",
    "* Maintains processing speed within 10% of baseline performance\n",
    "* Provides error messages that lead to resolution within one debugging cycle\n",
    "* Achieves 100% error detection rate for defined error categories\n",
    "* Enables recovery from at least 80% of non-critical errors\n",
    "* Requires minimal configuration for common use cases while remaining flexible for specific requirements\n",
